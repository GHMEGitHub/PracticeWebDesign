        <p>
          Dr. Mellish is an expert witness specializing in the valuation of loss due to business damages, wrongful termination, personal injury and death.
		  He has been qualified as an expert witness in the majority of the Circuit Courts in Florida and many Federal Courts in various
		  states including FL, GA, AL, NY, TX, CA, US Virgin Islands, and others.

		<p>
		 This office has a reputation for providing expert witness consultation at the highest standards.  We assist attorneys in
		 identifying areas of damages as well as calculating the present value of future losses including lost wages, benefits, the
		 value of household services, the amount necessary to provide medical care in the future, hedonic damages (value of the loss
		 of enjoyment of lifestyle issues) as well as punitive damages in cases that warrant it.  In worker&#39;s compensation cases, our
		 reports are often made a part of the fee petition package.  We have designed a computer-assisted format for presenting the 
		 results of our analysis in the worker&#39;s compensation cases.  We have also developed a computer-assisted format for
		 calculating the present value of future medical care items required in a life care plan for catastrophic injury cases. 
		 These computer assisted formats allows us to keep billing to a minimum by reducing the amount of professional time needed.

         <p>
		 Quite often attorneys call us to quickly estimate the level of economic damages in an injury or death case.  When the attorney can give us a short description of the nature of the injury, we can typically identify the probable damage elements:
		 </p>
			<ul>
			     <li>Loss of income or support</li>
				 <li>Loss of value of services</li>
				 <li>Probable future medical expenses</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
		We can usually provide an estimate in a 5 to 15 minute phone call. We do not charge for such brief consultations.  By contrast, a written report requires documentation for underlying data. That is what takes the most time and is billable.  Business damages cases are different from personal injury cases when it comes to quick estimates. That said, we can usually describe the type of underlying data that will be needed to estimate business damages in a 5 to 15 minute consultation.

		 The latest BLS figures on the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm" target="_blank"><b>US employment situation</b></a> as of April 2018 shows the Unemployment rate at 4.1% with a net decrease in unemployed persons of 121,000 and a net decline in employed persons of 37,000 with a total net reduction of 158,000 persons in the Labor Force.  The total net reduction in the Labor Force is equal to the decrease in the employed and unemployed persons, but this is misleading.  
		 The Labor Force consists only of the Employed and Unemployed and will always equal the two figures presented for these two categories.  A net reduction or increase in the civilian labor force can be age-related, education-related, health-related or economy-related (leading to discouragement). This can cause an increase in job creation to have less of an impact on the overall unemployment rate due to additional people being added to or leaving the labor force for these other reasons such as graduating from school or college, completing a rehabilitation program, being injured, early retirement, or simply reaching an age outside of the countable age for the Survey. The figures presented are the net change in these categories which includes in-flows to and out-flows from all categories.  The flows into and out of these categories give a better picture of what is happening in the employment/unemployment situation.  The following Flow Chart shows the BLS reported employment status changes for March 2018 (Flow Chart figures are <strong>in thousands</strong>).

		<p>
		The number of unemployed persons declined by only 121,000; however, it represents 3.5 million new unemployed persons and 3.6 million people leaving unemployed status.  According to the BLS data presented in the above diagram, only 1.9 million returned to work; the other 1.7 million left the Labor Force.  The 3.5 million new unemployed persons is made up of 1.7 million persons from the employed sector and 1.77 million persons entering or re-entering the Labor Force.  To get an accurate picture of the unemployment rate, it would be important to take a closer look at the Not in the Labor Force category.  How many persons are in this category due to economic conditions? 
		</p>
		<p>
		The unemployment rate reflects the percentage of those people represented in the Labor Force and does not include those who have become discouraged and are no longer seeking employment or who are under-employed due to economic conditions.  According to the BLS, these persons represent an additional 3.9% of the Labor Force bringing the unemployment rate up to 8% as of March 2018.

		<p>When the interest rate or discount rate is low, the present failure of future economic losses will be higher.  However, the other element in the present value calculation is the growth rate in wages, or in future medical expenses.  When interest rates are low, these other two elements of the present value calculations will also be low.  Therefore, the present value will not be substantially different than in a period of high interest rates.

		 According to Bankrate.com&#39;s survey of economists, we can expect another Fed Rate hike in December 2017.  The full results of their 1-year prediction poll is shown below:</p>
		 <p align="center"><a href="docs//economic-survey-forecast-at-a-glance-q3-2017.png" target="_blank"><img src="docs//economic-survey-forecast-at-a-glance-q3-2017.png" width="500" height="400" border="0" /><br /></a></p>

	<br />
		<p>
		 In 3rd Quarter 2017, economists predicted unemployment to drop slightly, 10-yr treasury bills to rise and jobs added per month to decrease within the year.  Let's take a look at the figures for 1st Quarter 2018 and see if they are on the right track for 2018:
		</p>
		 <p align="center"><a href="docs//Bankrate Pred v Actual.jpg target="_blank"><img src="docs//Bankrate Pred v Actual.jpg" width="500" height="400" border="0" /><br /></a></p>
            <p align="center"><br /><b>Click on image to enlarge.</b></p>
			<br />
		 <p>
		 According to the above table, the predictions were good, but it hasn’t been a year yet.  According to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/fed-hikes-rates-by-a-quarter-point-at-chair-powells-first-meeting.html" target="_blank"><b>March 2018 CNBC report</b></a>, the Fed is planning to increase the rate three more times this year; two of which will be before the end of the 1-year prediction period.  It is already at 1.75 and with two more hikes, it is likely to surpass the predicted rate.  Unemployment, as reported by <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000" target+"_blank"><b>BLS</b></a>, is already at the level predicted and could possibly stay at that level.  The declining jobs created figure is on its way to hit the mark according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ceshighlights.pdf" target="_blank"><b>March 2018 CES Report</b></a>, and could reach the prediction by Q3 2018.  The 10-year treasury yield surpassed the predicted rate according to the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2018" target="_blank"><b>US Treasury</b></a>; however, that is a moving target and fluctuates up and down daily, so it could come back down theoretically before the 1-yr period is up; however, it is unlikely given the additional Fed Rate hikes anticipated in 2018.  We will have to revisit this next quarter to see how things shape up.  If you want to discuss this in greater detail, please give me a call.
